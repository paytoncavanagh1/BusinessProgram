# Business Program
The goal of my program is to allow the user to order from a selection of snow wear. I will have 5 different items available for delivery. Each item will be stored in an array so that I can access each thing I want. The goal of the program is to have an easy to interact menu and be very simple and readable. It should display the menu with the prices listed. Each item listed will have a delivery fee based on what they ordered. I will have the order printed onto the output window so that itâ€™s neat and organized. In this receipt, I will output the items that the user ordered, the price, the color, size, and quantity. The specific audience for this program is anyone interested in snow gear or snowboarding. Some strengths of this program will be the organization and readability and some potential weaknesses could be listing each individual item along with their color/size/quantity. The table will appear for other items but if you list the same item with different combinations, some problems arise. As for future improvement, I could add the code to an actual website so that other companies can use my service and order snow items.
